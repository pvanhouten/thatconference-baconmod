To Check from Windows 7 you click on the start button and right-click Computer. From the menu choose **Properies**.

In Windows 8, from the start screen, type **my computer**. When it shows in the search list, right click on it and choose **Properties**  
  
  
#### Installing Eclipse
Inclipse doesn't require an installer.  You basically copy it into a folder and run eclipse.exe.  Wen you open the Eclipse zip file you will see a folder named *eclipse*.  Simply copy this folder into c:\Program Files\ and create a shortcut to eclipse.exe on your desktop or taskbar.  

Simply double-click the shortcut and you are good to go. 

#### Installing Minecraft Forge
Create a folder where you want to create your mod.  For simplicity we are going to create the folder on the desktop and name it BaconMod  

Once you have the folder crated, open the zip file from Minecraft Forge and copy its contents into your BaconMod folder.  
  
Now we need to decompile Minecraft and setup our mod to work with Eclipse.  Don't worry, the Minecraft Forge people made this very simple.  

While holding the shit key down, right-click anywhere in the blank area of the BaconMod folder.  From the menu select **Open command window here**.  This will open a command window and save you the trouble of having to type in the path of where you need to be.  

From the command window type (letter cAsE matters!):  

`gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`  

Once that complete then type this in the command window:  

`gradlew eclipse`

   
   
You are now ready to build some mods!  Open eclipse.  Have eclipse open the Workspace at BaconMod\eclipse and write some code!
