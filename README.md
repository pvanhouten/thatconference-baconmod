#Don't go outside; stay inside and make your first Minecraft mod!

###Welcome to That Conference 2014!

That sandbox outside is crawling with ants and the neighborhood bully keeps knocking down your sand castle.  Forget that!  Stay inside where it's cool and you can play in your own private sandbox, Minecraft.  But did you know you can make it even better by writing your own mods?

My 8-year-old son is obsessed with Minecraft, so I thought I'd see what the fuss was all about.  I was instantly hooked--fascinated by the complexities of the game and further by its flexibility in extending and adding new features.  Bring your kids and learn the basics about writing your first Minecraft mod!  

In this session, we will create the legendary set of That Conference bacon armor, tools, weapons and more!  We will be walking through:

- Setting up your IDE (Eclipse)
- Installing Minecraft Forge
- Creating recipes, smelting, items, and blocks
- Packaging the mod for distribution

The recommended age for this session is 6th grade and up for children who want to learn about creating Minecraft mods using Eclipse.  Parents who want to work with their younger children (2nd through 5th grade) to create mods are welcome to join us as well!


All original mod code was written by [pvanhouten](http://twitter.com/pvanhouten).  Feel free to modify and distribute as you like.
